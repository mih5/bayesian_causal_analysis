Bayesian Causal Analysis

RESEARCH QUESTION: Do complementary and alternative asthma treatments
affect respiratory fitness?

DESCRIPTION: Used subclassification on propensity scores to induce covariate balance.  
Then used Neyman's repeated sampling approach and Bayesian linear regression/model imputation to estimate the population average treatment effect of complementary and alternative asthma treatments on a measure of respiratory fitness.
